# React + TypeScript Conventions

These rules apply to `.ts` and `.tsx` files in a Next.js project. If the project's instructions or lint configuration say otherwise, follow the project and report the difference. Rules marked **(lint)** are usually enforced by ESLint or Prettier; trust the tool output over manual judgment for those.

## Naming

| What                    | Rule                                                    | Example                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| slice folder            | kebab-case                                              | `user-profile/`                           |
| component file          | PascalCase (shadcn primitives keep upstream kebab-case) | `ui/HomePage.tsx`, `shared/ui/button.tsx` |
| hook, util, other files | camelCase                                               | `getQueryClient.ts`, `cn.ts`              |
| props type              | PascalCase + `Props`                                    | `HomePageProps`                           |
| other types             | PascalCase, no kind suffix                              | `User`, `UserResponse`                    |
| request type            | PascalCase + `Request`                                  | `UpdateProfileRequest`                    |
| Zod schema              | PascalCase + `Schema`                                   | `EnvSchema`, `UpdateProfileSchema`        |

## Types

- Use `interface` for object shapes and `type` for unions and combinations.
- Do not use `enum`. Use a literal union with an `as const` object or a `Record`. **(lint)**
- Import types with `import type`. **(lint)**
- Do not add kind suffixes such as `Type` to type names. Add a role word only when a value (class or constant) already uses the name: the constructor input of the `ApiError` class is `ApiErrorInit`.

## Components

- Write components as arrow functions and destructure props.
- Modules under `src` use named exports only, and the owning slice's `index.ts` re-exports them by the same name. Default exports belong only to the files Next.js requires them in (`app/` route files and config files), which re-export the slice component as `default`:

  ```tsx
  // src/_pages/home/ui/HomePage.tsx
  interface HomePageProps {
    title: string;
  }

  export const HomePage = ({ title }: HomePageProps) => <h1>{title}</h1>;

  // src/_pages/home/index.ts
  export { HomePage } from './ui/HomePage';

  // app/page.tsx
  export { HomePage as default } from '@/_pages/home';
  ```

- To enforce this, add an ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` entry for `ExportDefaultDeclaration` and `ExportSpecifier[exported.name='default']` scoped to `src/**`. When that override also sets `no-restricted-syntax`, repeat any existing entries (such as the `enum` ban) because a later block replaces the rule's options.

- Order inside a component: variables and hooks → handlers and other logic → `useEffect` (only when needed) → `return`.
- Do not add state or effects just to follow this order. When React Compiler is enabled, do not add memoization by hand.
- Accessibility: connect a label to every input, use the right element for buttons and links, and give images `alt`.

## Server and client

- Components are Server Components by default. Add `'use client'` only to the smallest component that needs state, events, or browser APIs.
- Client components do not read server environment variables or import server-only modules.

## Imports

- Order: `react` → `next` → external packages → `@/` → relative paths. **(lint)**
- Outside a slice, import only from its public `index.ts` (or `index.server.ts`).

Run the project's lint, type check, and formatter after changes. The `frontend-convention-validator` agent reviews the rules that tools do not check.
