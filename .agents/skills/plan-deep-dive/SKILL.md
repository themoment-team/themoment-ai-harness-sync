description: Conduct an in-depth structured interview with the user to uncover non-obvious requirements, tradeoffs, and constraints, then produce a detailed implementation spec file.
allowed-tools: AskUserQuestion, Write
---

Interview the user in detail about the requested feature or task — cover technical implementation, architecture decisions, edge cases, tradeoffs, and concerns. Ask non-obvious, in-depth questions. Continue interviewing until you have enough information, then write the complete spec to a file named `SPEC.md`.

Cover at minimum:
- Functional requirements
- Data model changes (entities, DTOs)
- API design (endpoints, request/response)
- Business logic and validation rules
- Error cases and exception handling
- Security considerations
- Test scenarios
